# Kitchen Animated Scene

This is a personal project for my Introduction to Programming II class where a mug is moved across a kitchen countertop.

## How to Run

1. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository into your working machine.
2. Make sure that you have [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) installed in your machine. It is recommended to use Java 8 or older.
3. Run the command line. Change your working directory into the directory where you cloned this repository. A bunch of [.java]() files can be found there. Check by typing `dir` on Windows or `ls` on MacOS/Linux in your command line. Once there, enter the following commands:

```console
$ javac *.java
$ java SceneStarter.java
```

## How to Use

1. Just press `Move the Mug` and the red mug will move to the left across the countertop. When it runs out of a surface, it goes back to its initial position.

Enjoy!
